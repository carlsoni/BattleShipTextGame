#First the ships are initalized via where the player wants the ships head placead and which direction the tail will go

#Ex: head is at A 3 and the player selects to have the 2 spot ship be placed vertcaly, the ship will be stored in arrays
    #A at location 2 for the head, and B at Location 2 for the tail
    
#There will be 3 ships, one is 2 tiles, one is 3 tiles, and one is 4 tiles. 

#When stored on the map, a map tile will switch from a 0 to a 1, this will be the ending storage unless we have time to build a user #interface
